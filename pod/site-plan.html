      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Podcasts are everywhere nowadays. Google advises me that there are over 850,000 active ones worldwide right now, with some 48 million episodes. And over 100 million people listening to them.</p>
        <p>I will discuss a few of them. But I am just one old man, who happens to listen to a couple of podcasts what would I know about them? Truthfully not an awful lot. Which is why I also plan to talk to people of all ages; see what podcasts they listen to. By all ages, I mean if they are old enough to have a cell-phone I want their opinion. I will then share what I find out about some of them & even show some of the places where you might listen to them.
        Did you, or someone you know, listen to a podcast you think others might be interested in? Or do you just have a question about a Podcast? I will also leave a feedback page, where you can tell us about it & we might just feature it on our webpage for the world to see as well.
        </p>  


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be whomever either listens to, or is curious about podcasts. Statistically 50% of all podcast listeners are aged 12 – 34, so I plan to start by placing flyers on bulletin boards in the local schools. Another 43% are aged between 35 – 54 years old, so I would also advertise at places like the local library and grocery stores.</p>
      <p>My intended audience should also be those who are interested in broadening their horizons so to speak. Learning about some of the more than 2 million podcasts out there, just to see if they might be interested. </p>

        Welcome, to the home page of let’s talk podcasts. We’re glad you’re here.   
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who don’t know a podcast, generally speaking, is like a radio show.  You will have one or more individuals who host the show, and they can be any length. Anywhere from a 60 second news snippet to a 3 hour in -depth interview.  Some of them tell you a story, similar to the way you might have come to expect as you sat listening to the radio back before television in say 1922. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at let’s talk podcasts our goal is to talk about a few of them. With there being literally millions of podcasts out there today all vying for your time, we understand that it can be hard trying to determine which one(s) you want to listen to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not paid by or affiliated with any podcast, that way we can offer our genuine un-biased opinion on some podcasts. We won’t tell you to go listen to any particular podcast, we leave that up to you to decide. But for example, if you’re maybe the parent of a 17-year-old high school student, and are curious what they are listening to for example. We will interview a couple high school students and ask them what they listen to & what makes it appealing to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you a new mother? A new dad? Are you interested in Football? How about Food? How about Wine? Just in case you were wondering, yes there are podcasts about all those topics as well, and plenty more.

        The review: If you enjoy reading a good horror story, think a good Stephen King novel for an example, then you will most likely also enjoy this.
