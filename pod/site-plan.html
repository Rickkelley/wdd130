      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Podcasts are everywhere nowadays. Google advises me that there are over 850,000 active ones worldwide right now, with some 48 million episodes. And over 100 million people listening to them.</p>
        <p>I will discuss a few of them. But I am just one old man, who happens to listen to a couple of podcasts what would I know about them? Truthfully not an awful lot. Which is why I also plan to talk to people of all ages; see what podcasts they listen to. By all ages, I mean if they are old enough to have a cell-phone I want their opinion. I will then share what I find out about some of them & even show some of the places where you might listen to them.
        Did you, or someone you know, listen to a podcast you think others might be interested in? Or do you just have a question about a Podcast? I will also leave a feedback page, where you can tell us about it & we might just feature it on our webpage for the world to see as well.
        </p>  


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be whomever either listens to, or is curious about podcasts. Statistically 50% of all podcast listeners are aged 12 – 34, so I plan to start by placing flyers on bulletin boards in the local schools. Another 43% are aged between 35 – 54 years old, so I would also advertise at places like the local library and grocery stores.</p>
      <p>My intended audience should also be those who are interested in broadening their horizons so to speak. Learning about some of the more than 2 million podcasts out there, just to see if they might be interested. </p>
