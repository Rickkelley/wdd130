            <h4>Podcast name "The Magnus Archives"</h4>
            <p>
                Synopsis: The Magnus Archives is a weekly horror fiction anthology podcast examining what lurks in the
                archives of the Magnus Institute, an organization dedicated to researching the esoteric and the weird. Join new
                head archivist Jonathan Sims as he attempts to bring a seemingly neglected collection of supernatural
                statements up to date, converting them to audio and supplementing them with follow-up work from his small but
                dedicated team
            </p>
            <p>
                The review: If you enjoy reading a good horror story, think a good Stephen King novel for an example,
                then you will most likely also enjoy this. As I was interviewing people, just prior to my publishing of this
                site, a vast majority of them listed this as on of their top 3 podcasts. We the staff her at let's talk podcasts have
                also listened to this one, and it come highly recommended by them as well.
