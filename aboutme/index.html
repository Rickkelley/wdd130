    <h2>Rick Kelley</h2>
    
    <p>I am currently enrolled as an online student, working to get a bachelors degree in Computer information Technology.
        I chose that degree since computers are my hobby. I love to build them, fix them, play games on them,
        etc. Being an online student, and taking a computer degree just sort of seemed to fit. Whlie I do love my family, and enjoy 
        being able to spend time with them my computer comes in a close second place.
    </p>
    <P>I live in Utah, roughly 45 minute drive north from temple square in downtown Salt Lake City. I also am currently married, as of April 20th this year I will have been married for 20 wonderful years. Which that should give you a guess
        as to how old I am, and whle I won't tell you my exact age here I will give you a hint. That would be that I was alive to watch the moon landing live on
        television with my parents. My wife Peggie and I so far have only been blessed with one daughter, which while we would welcome more and have been
        doing our part in that process so far that just doesn't seem to be in the cards for us. I can tell you that there are days where dealing with 
        that one is enough that I wonder if maybe the Lords knows we just couldn't handle more than that. My wife works nights, I have the day shift, which
        means that we never have to hire a babysitter. Being alone all night just my daughter like that & I has made for both some really precious memories as well as 
        some of the most frustrating headaches. 
    </P>
    <p>Being a little bit older, that also means I do have a job, I have spent the last 19 years working at Citibank. Having that many years invested already, I am not planning to change
        companies anytime soon. Once I have my degree, I am hoping to be able and get another better paying position with the company. I do want to
        clarify that no I don't work at a physical branch as a teller or anything. Rather I work for a call center which services the private label credit cards. 
        By private label that means it doesn't say Citibank on the card, rather it will say The Home Depot, or Staples as a couple examples. Also my department only handles
        commercial cards, meaning that the name of the card is a company not a person. So for example if BYU wanted a The Home Depot credit card that would come to my department. 
        I have just moved into the highline credit department, where it is our responiblity to handle all applications & or line of credit increases over $25,000. When I moved to this new
        department, I was surprised to learn that during the spring rush we handle over 100 requests a day for The Home Depot alone. While $50,000 is a rather common number
        in my department we do also see those companies with a line of credit into the millions of dollars. Which one of the biggest perks to this job is that I get to work from home. I do still have
        a regular schedule I have to show up & clock in by a certain time of day & work. I both process the applications as well as answer the telephone if someone calls our department. But come lunch time
        I get to go eat lunch with my wife. With the daughter off to school, it's almost like having a date (even if it is only 30 minutes long) every day. Then when it's time to go back to work it is only a few seconds down the hall to my home office.
